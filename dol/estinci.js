/**
 * Draws elements in front of this view, stacked in the order that you list them.
 *
 * This function allows you to specify multiple elements to be drawn in front
 * of the current view. The elements will be layered such that the first element
 * in the list is drawn first (closest to the base layer), and each subsequent
 * element is drawn on top of the previous one.
 *
 * @param {View} view - The base view in front of which the elements will be drawn.
 * @param {Array<Element>} elements - An array of elements to be drawn in front of the view.
 *
 * @example
 * // Assuming `view` is your current view and `drawElementsInFront` is the function:
 * const elements = [element1, element2, element3];
 * drawElementsInFront(view, elements);
 *
 * // In this example, `element1` will be drawn first, followed by `element2`, and
 * // finally `element3`, resulting in `element3` being the topmost element.
 */
function drawElementsInFront(view, elements) {
    elements.forEach(element => {
        // Assuming each element has a `draw` method that takes a view as context
        element.draw(view);
    });
}
